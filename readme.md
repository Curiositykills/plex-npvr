Plex plugin for use with NextPVR

This is a super-early release of a NextPVR plugin for Plex for watching live TV. Please have the latest versions of both. Thanks to psyciknz (https://github.com/psyciknz/NextPVR-Plex) for his code which I used for an example. I've updated / changed the code base enough I didn't think it prudent to fork.

This plugin uses the new NextPVR webservice and handles channels with sub-channels (example: channel 4 is actually 4.1, 4.2, 4.3).

This is super early code, and while it works for me, you may need ot tweak it. As always, copy the npvr.bundle to your Plex Media Server plug-ins folder to use. Make sure you configure this plugin (with the settings gear icon in Plex).

I intend to add channel icons for Live TV and am considering adding more function in the future.
